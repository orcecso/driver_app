This directory is designated for reusable, small, and atomic widgets.
These widgets should follow the principles of atomic design, meaning they are
the smallest possible components, focused on a single responsibility, and
can be combined to form larger molecules or organisms.

When adding new widgets here, ensure they are:
- Reusable across different parts of the application.
- Small and focused on a single UI element or interaction.
- Independent of specific business logic (presentational only).
- Well-documented with comments if their purpose isn't immediately clear.

Examples include: buttons, text fields, icons, avatars, etc.
